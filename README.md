### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've over 7 years of experience in software development as a Java Developer in a vast variety of sectors. I'm mostly experienced with creating new functionalities design and development, software testing, and implementing multithreading environment solutions. Last few years I was working in Scrum teams on projects concerning key e-commerce, backoffice, and finance applications for corporate clients. I'm oriented for further development as Java Developer in mentioned sectors.
